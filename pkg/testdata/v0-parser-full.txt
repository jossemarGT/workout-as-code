// Testing all the capabilities supported by v0 Workout language parser.
//
// In case I forget to document this somewhere the EBNF representation of the
// v0 Workout language goes as follows:
//
//      Workout = <wtitle>? (Set | Circuit)* .
//      Circuit = <ctitle> Set+ .
//      Set = <quantity> Exercise .
//      Exercise = <gstring> .
//
// == Details worth noticing
// - All the strings are "greedy" making this language newline dependent
// - Comments were defined for mere convenience on the language design
// - Comments are only when // are used at the beginning of the line
// - The parser follows a formal language but it *must* be forgiving on user input
//
// Got a suggestion? Pull requests are welcome ;)
