# Workout as code

> Are you a tired developer with a bunch of workouts in many places? Get WAC!

Workout as code (WAC) is a structured way of storing workouts in plain text.
No more bookmarks on your social media apps ;)

## The wishilist - v0 Roadmap

- [x] Write down the WAC idea (more or less)
- [ ] Dump initial workouts as plain files. **Human oriented** and machine readable
- [ ] Define WAC v0 YAML file schema. *One way all the way*
- [ ] Prototype tool to export workouts for any WOD app. Target "Seconds" mobile app
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!

PS: Do not add copyrighted workouts please!
