<!--
Testing all the capabilities supported by v0 Workout language parser.

In case I forget to document this somewhere the EBNF representation of the
v0 Workout language goes as follows:

      Workout = <wodtitle>? (Set | Circuit)* .
      Circuit = Title+ Set* .
      Set = <quantity> Exercise .
      Exercise = <gstring> .
      Title = Fragment* (<metadiv> Metadata+)? <titleend> .
      Fragment = (<tgstring> | <puntc>) .
      Metadata = (<wodtype> | <quantity> | Word) .
      Word = <ident> (<colon> Tag)? .
      Tag = (<quantity> | <ident>) .

== Details worth noticing
- This language's goal is to be flexible enough for humans to share their workouts
- This language takes inspiration over Markdown due to its popularity, but it is not fully compatible
- This language simulates 2 column tables using spaces and newlines.
- ^ Unfortunately this langauge's tables do not render correctly on MD viewers without workarounds
- Markdonw elements like title and comments work as expected
- As a rule of thumbs is suggested to add an extra new line for every title.
- ^ Otherwise, if that title holds metadata will end up consuming the first execise as metadata
- All the strings outside the titles are "greedy" so the comments do not work there

Got a suggestion? Pull requests are welcome ;)
