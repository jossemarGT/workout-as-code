# Workout as code

> Are you a tired developer with a bunch of workouts in many places? Get WAC!

Workout as code (WAC) is a simple but structured way of storing workouts.
No more bookmarks on your social media apps ;)

## The wishilist - v0 Roadmap

- [x] Write down the idea (more or less)
- [x] Dump initial workouts as plain files. **Human oriented** and machine readable
- [ ] Prototype wac tool- Lint workout files
- [ ] Prototype wac tool - Export workouts as "Seconds" mobile app input file
- [ ] *Maybe* separate the tool src code from workouts data
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!
