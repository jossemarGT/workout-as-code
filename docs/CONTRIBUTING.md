# Contributing to Workout as Code

:muscle: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :muscle:

## Contribution Guidelines

* To add, remove or update a workout to the repository: Please, submit a pull request
* When adding a new workout, consider using the `bin/new-workout.sh` helper. But you are free to do it manually.
* All the workouts are valid markdown files and reside into `data/` directory
* Make sure **you** already have tried out the workout for yourself before submitting. Let's keep it genuine.
* Please follow the Workout V0 language. It is futher elaborated on the [README file](../README.md).

## Verifying your contribution

Every pull request will trigger a github action to verify the following:

- The new contents under `data/` are valid markdown documents (markdown lint)
- The new contents under `data/` are Workout V0 language compliant

When all the verification pass, you are good to go. Read you on the PR thread :muscle:
